### FifaApiScrapy


This repo contains a small Scrapy script that explains how to scrape data from the hidden or non-public API of the Fifa website. It also shows how to choose the data you want, modify it and add to it as needed before further processing.
I chose to work on the world rankings of the men's and women's national football teams.
